# BitWrite Framework

BitWrite is a modular and extensible framework designed to facilitate the development of robust applications using modern architectural patterns such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and Event Sourcing.

## Overview

The BitWrite Framework is designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable applications. It leverages best practices in software architecture to ensure that your application is both flexible and robust.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key modules:

- **BitWrite.Abstraction**: Contains core interfaces and base definitions used across the framework.
- **BitWrite.Core**: Implements core functionalities and shared utilities.
- **BitWrite.Cqrs**: Provides implementations for the CQRS pattern.
- **BitWrite.EventSourcing**: Handles event sourcing logic and aggregate management.
- **BitWrite.Infrastructure**: Manages persistence and integration with external systems.

## Getting Started

To get started with BitWrite, clone the repository and build the solution using your preferred IDE. Ensure you have the necessary .NET SDK installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/BitWrite-Framework.git
cd BitWrite-Framework
dotnet build
```

## Core Concepts

### Domain-Driven Design

BitWrite embraces DDD principles to ensure that the domain logic is at the heart of the application. This includes:

- **Entities and Value Objects**: Defined in the `Domain` layer to encapsulate business logic.
- **Aggregates**: Managed using the `AggregateFactory` to ensure consistency and integrity.

### CQRS

The framework implements CQRS to separate read and write operations, improving scalability and performance. Key components include:

- **Commands and Queries**: Defined in the `Commands` and `Queries` modules.
- **Handlers**: Implemented to process commands and queries efficiently.

### Event Sourcing

Event Sourcing is used to persist the state of aggregates as a sequence of events. This allows for:

- **Rehydration**: Using `AggregateFactory` to recreate aggregate state from events.
- **Auditability**: Complete history of changes is maintained.

## Exception Handling

BitWrite provides a robust exception handling mechanism with a hierarchy of custom exceptions:

- **BaseException**: The root of all custom exceptions.
- **DomainException, ApiException, AppException**: Specialized exceptions for different layers.
- **Http Exceptions**: For handling HTTP-specific errors.

## Factories

Factories in BitWrite are used to manage the creation of complex objects:

- **AggregateFactory**: Utilizes expression trees for efficient creation of aggregates with parameterless constructors.
